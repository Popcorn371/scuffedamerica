 california.3.t:0 "The Phoenix Speech"
 california.3.d:0 "I will be brief in my comments. I was appointed many months ago to get the victory that, until moments ago, many in a foolheardty legislation thought impossible. Now I stand before you, the broken and tired enemy. I wish to make one thing clear to you; It is foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died. Rather we should thank God that such men lived. In this model, we have seen a truth and understanding to our great American ideal, a process of hope for a reunification. Americans, across everywhere, will sooner or later be damned into uniting with eachother, for an American cannot live without associating with his other fellow Americans. Lincoln taught us that. Lincoln also taught us to not hide ourselves, to piss away, from an advantageous position, even if it meant the forceful nature that we Americans love to use. When I was offered the position months ago to take charge of this great State and to seek an immediate conclusion to threats other Americans posed to us, I accepted because of the shit-slinging belly-up bastard aching that I saw in our Capitol hill. I will remind you all of what I said many months ago, in exactly that situation taking office; A good solution applied with vigor now is better than a perfect solution applied ten minutes later. This has been a tough, brutal, and devestating fight. In time, you may hate us for our conquering. But you will be reminded and you will be led, for you are an American. And Americans, even if they hate every other place on earth, will, in the end, have to be together with other Americans. Wars may be fought with weapons, but they are won by men. It is the spirit of the men who follow and of the man who leads that gains the victory. And through our victory, by thanking the alive and by serving together, we can achieve an everlasting glory. Right, you damn Bolshevik naysayers!, you get what I mean, we'll take back our nation and we'll keep on moving at the bastards. That's all"

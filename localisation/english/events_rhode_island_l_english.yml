    rhode_island.1.t: "1936 Rhode Island Presidential Election"
    rhode_island.1.d: "Election Seasons have never been this tense before, however nobody knew why. Perhaps it was the constant labor strikes, the weak authority of the Rhode Island government, or maybe it was the opposition to the democrats finally revealed. The Socialist Party of Rhode Island had gain alot of popularity during this year. As it turned out the leader of this party was none other than the author H.P Lovecraft. Lovecraft held a speech to crowd of people proclaiming Rhode Island's government a failure for being far too weak to govern and that they step down in this election. After this speech it seems the Democrat's hold on Rhode Island is unable to hold."

    rhode_island.2.d: "In 1930, Rhode Island would become the first state to offically secede from the United States. To many in Rhode Island, this was a very bold move for a state of our size. However it was clear the writing on the wall was that the United States had failed. Soon as we left the other states followed. But now we face a great issue on our hands as Worker's all over the state have had enough and a huge string of strikes had began. Our government couldn't end them without a great upset in the party and government. It is now 1936 and the situation has enflamed the state being the leading issue. It is now President Theodore's final term in office and the time's ticking to retain the government's hold on this state."

However when they arrived and began their talks, it seems that they couldn't agree on almost anything. President Theodore attempted to persuade the leaders into ending the strikes. One of them even brought up Theodore's aristocratic upbringing which had lead to the leaders all storming out of the meeting location. Leaving no solution to the strikes in sight"

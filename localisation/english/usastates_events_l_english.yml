Shockingly Disney has enacted a “public safety campaign” that has arrested and jailed many Jewish people in California. The exact numbers are unknown but it is likely to be thousands. Disney has also created a censorship bureau to prevent any more news of the atrocities that likely happen in California. Disneyland Epcot is established in Hollywood and is the only place that is publicly known but it is only a pro Disney propaganda park.
